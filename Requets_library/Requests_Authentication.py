                    ##Authentication using Python Requests
Authentication refers to giving a user permissions to access a particular resource.
Since, everyone canâ€™t be allowed to access data from every URL, one would require authentication primarily.
To achieve this authentication, typically one provides authentication data through Authorization header or
a custom header defined by server.


# import requests module 
import requests 
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth 

# Making a get request 
response = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user',auth = HTTPBasicAuth('shubhamrocks888','Monty@888')) 

#
print(response)
#Output: <Response [200]>
